# webcats
We went to settings and enabled GitHub Pages, so now this site is hosted https://ludlowcode.github.io/webcats/

If you want to make a change, you can press full stop on your keyboard when logged in, change the code or the content, and commit it (the icon underneath search) with a little message about what you changed. It will say to create a fork, which you do, and then you will create a 'pull request' which allows me to 'pull' your change into the main page!
